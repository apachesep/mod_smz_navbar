# mod_smz_navbar
**This is a responsive, Bootstrap based, alternative to Joomla mod_menu**

Notable features are:

* Fully responsive: adapts itself to a "mobile" view on narrow screen devices.
* Based on Twitter Bootstrap (2.3.2)
* HTML5 compliant (_uses the "nav" element_)
* Possiblity to generate a "_Full Navbar_", complete with a "_Brand_" (logo) and an "_hamburger button_" for mobile devices
* Dropdowns with "on hover" activation (optional)
* Possibility to hide menu items by assigning them the CSS pseudo-class of #hidden (_hides itself and all his childrens_) or #hiding (_hides children only_)
* Possibility to add icons to menu items, via the menu item "Notes" field.
* Integrated "Language Switcher" (optional)

This module works best when displayed at the top of the screen and at full width.
